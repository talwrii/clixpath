# clixpath

A command-line tool to extract the values of *Xpath* expressions from *HTML* and XML documents.
It's distinguishing features are intended ease of use, and producing output that can be parsed programmatically.
Supports value extraction analogous to captuure groups in regexp.

Tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5.

# Installing

```
pip install git+https://github.com/talwrii/clixpath#egg=clixpath
```

# Examples / Cheat sheet

```bash
#Basic usage
$ curl -L --silent http://xkcd.com/1833 | clixpath '//img/@src'
/s/0b7742.png
//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality_3.png
//imgs.xkcd.com/s/a899e84.jpg


#Machine readable output (the main reason for this tool)
$ curl -L --silent http://xkcd.com/1833 | clixpath --json '//img'
{"file": "STDIO", "markup": "<img src=\"/s/0b7742.png\" alt=\"xkcd.com logo\" height=\"83\" width=\"185\"/>", "path": "/html/body/div[@id=\"topContainer\"]/div[@id=\"topRight\"]/div[@id=\"masthead\"]/span/a/img"}
{"file": "STDIO", "markup": "<img src=\"//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality_3.png\" title=\"It's like a half-solved cryptogram where the solution is a piece of FORTH code written by someone who doesn't know FORTH.\" alt=\"Code Quality 3\" srcset=\"//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality_3_2x.png 2x\"/>\n", "path": "/html/body/div[@class=\"box\" and @id=\"middleContainer\"]/div[@id=\"comic\"]/img"}

# Usage

```
usage: clixpath [-h] [--json] [--drop DROP] [--extract KEY VALUE]
                [--no-key NO_KEY]
                xpath [file [file ...]]

Extract data from an html/xml file using xpath

positional arguments:
  xpath                 Xpath expression
  file                  File to operate on. (Path included in json)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --json, -J            Produce output in machine readable json
  --drop DROP, -d DROP  Delete xpaths from result
  --extract KEY VALUE, -x KEY VALUE
                        Takes args KEY XPATH and extact XPATH from matches and
                        stores in in KEY
  --no-key NO_KEY, -n NO_KEY
                        Do not include this item in output. (E.g. markup)

# Alternatives considered before writing

- **xmlstarlet** I always forget how this works, and I couldn't make it like HTML with 5 minutes work
- **xmllint**  Easy to use, but I could not make the output easily parseable
- **xidel** Considered, but I doubted it would produce machine readable output, and it was in pascal
- **pq** Did not produce machine readable output
- **htmlpath** Did not produce machine readable output, project seemed too small to justify taking up the authors time pushing changes
- **cli-scrape**  Didn't run when I used it, gave up after 5 minutes (sorry for the FUD)
- **XSLT** useful for more general tasks, boilerplate plus learning curve
- **lxml in python** mostly the same as xslt with a slightly more shallow learning curve at the price of requiring turing completeness.
- **Converting your XML / HTML into json** you can then use JSON tools like *jq*. See, for example, [xml2json](https://github.com/hay/xml2json). I found this approach problematic when using XML with namespaces.
- **XPath 2.0** and **XQuery** support [some transformation of data](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11372160/how-to-do-group-capture-in-xpath) that could be used for this sort of task, albeit with some boiler plate. A cursory inspection of open source tools failed to find any tools that I would describe as "do what I mean convenient command line tools". Though the reader might like to be aware of [xqilla](http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/) and [galax](http://galax.sourceforge.net/)

# Testing

- If you write tests in the `tests` directory, then I will trust you code more.
- If you run tox then it will work when I run it before merging your code...

# Caveats

This tool is in the category of convenience utilities rather than a general-purpose tool.
It makes common tasks easy and general tasks impossible.

I may not accept your patch on the grounds of something being too complicated for this tool.
The most likely place that this will come up is support for building recursive *JSON* records using the `--extract` option.

In such cases a more powerful tool like *XSLT* or *lxml* in python should be used.

Do not expect any code that depends on parsing *non*-JSON output to not getting broken.
