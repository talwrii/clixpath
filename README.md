# Alternatives considered before writing

- **xmlstarlet** I always forget how this works, and I couldn't make it like HTML with 5 minutes work
- **xmllint**  Easy to use, but I could not make the output easily parseable
- **xidel** Considered, but I doubted it would produce machine readable output, and it was in pascal
- **pq** Did not produce machine readable output
- **htmlpath** Did not produce machine readable output, project seemed too small to justify taking up the authors time pushing changes
- **cli-scrape**  Didn't run when I used it, gave up after 5 minutes (sorry for the FUD)
